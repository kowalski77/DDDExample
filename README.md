# SnackMachine in DDD

- Domain Driven Design sample project. 
- The domain layer emulates the functionality of a vending machine.
- During development, only TDD has been used.
- It has only been intended to develop the Domain layer in depth along with the related tests.
- All other layers in an application with Clean Architecture are not deployed.
- This example of a vending machine is valid to take as the basis for other more complex DDD applications.
